# Tuner Control-Plane App — Consolidated Spec (delta over #285 / #288)

Consolidates: **#285** (control-surface RFC — the framing) + **#288**
(`docs/tuner-implementation-and-telemetry.md` — the AUTHORITATIVE spec for the
core) + **everything that landed in recent PRs** (new surfaces). Goal: a single
app that makes the whole self-improvement + governance system visible and
steerable, behind the human gate.

> ⚠️ **The core is ALREADY specified in #288** — do not reinvent:
> - **§4** telemetry contract `1.2.0` (11 streams + schemas + producers + the
>   **view-manifest** joining proposals→outcomes).
> - **§5** proposal payload (alternatives + tradeoffs + signed audit chain).
> - **§6** gate surface — including the **"discuss path" = inject full proposal
>   context into the agent** (= the discussion page below).
> - **§9** the "what the app renders" table: Health dashboard · Pending
>   decisions · Approve/choose/refuse/**discuss** · Outcomes · Visual git ·
>   Per-subject drill-down.
> - **§10** scheduling (adaptive daily sweep 24h→168h backoff · `mature`
>   keep/auto-revert · weekly cheap-first proactive pass).
>
> **This doc = the DELTA on top of #288/#285**: the surfaces from recent PRs
> not covered by §9 (watchdog/forensics, agent-jobs, eval/bench, kanban), a
> build-fast blueprint borrowed from a battle-tested internal ops dashboard,
> and the **Config** + **Discussion** pages (the latter = #288 §6's discuss
> path extended into a chat page).

## 0. Stack decision (reuse a proven blueprint, don't reinvent)

Same stack as a battle-tested internal operations dashboard (18 pages in
production on the same class of data: feeds, automations, alerts, jobs, roles):

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 5 + Vite + TS. Reusable component library:
  `StatusBadge`, per-entity `*Card`, `DashboardSummaryCard`, `FeedItemCard`,
  **`PermissionGate`** (role-gated mutations).
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLite, one router per domain (`/tuner/*`).
- **Auth**: `PermissionGate` + token pattern (see #220/#231 for the httpOnly
  cookie discussion).
- **Live**: WS `tuner.events` (new proposal / apply / revert) — same pattern as
  a live feed.
- **Tauri**: optional desktop wrapper over the same frontend (#285), later
  phase.

## 1. Surface INVENTORY (updated with merged PRs)

### Already LIVE (merged) — what the app must read/steer

| Surface | PR | What the app exposes |
|---|---|---|
| **Telemetry `telemetry__*`** (read-only) | #286 | streams + `capabilities`/`query` → Observability panel |
| **skill_access producer** | #289 | one more stream (skill access) |
| **Gate `tuner__*`** (propose/pending/apply/refuse/mature/propose_external) | #287 | Gate queue + Outcomes |
| **OutcomeLoop + model_routing** (reactive) | #287 | outcomes baseline→verdict, auto-revert |
| **mcp_plugin subject** (capability-gap, gated install) | #290 | Subjects panel + gated plugin install |
| **memory subject** (hygiene + proactive) | #291 | Subjects + memory proposals |
| **skills subject** (content patch) | #293 | Subjects + skill patch |
| **Stall watchdog + forensics** | #297/#300 | **NEW Watchdog/Forensics panel** (wedged sessions, kill escalation #298) |
| **Kill escalation governance** | #298 | kill/flagged status per invocation |
| **Bash-exec guard (PreToolUse)** | #302 | **NEW**: active hooks/guards + refusals |
| **Agent-job primitive `dispatch_job`** | #303 | **NEW Agent-jobs panel** (dispatch/status/list/cancel) |
| **Kanban subagent activity** | #299 | Kanban panel (UI exists, integrate) |
| **git-commit in apply** | #287+ | visual git tracking |

### In review (integrate as they merge)

| Surface | PR | Panel |
|---|---|---|
| **model_routing proactive** (benchmark reroute, quality-gated) | #292 | Scouts + reroute proposals + benchmark provenance |
| **eval-framework-mcp** (offline bench: pass-rate/cost/latency, recommend_tier) | #80 | **NEW Bench/Eval panel** (eval sets, runs, recommended tier) |

### Scouts (external research feeders)

Scheduled scout runs (model_routing #292 / mcp_plugin / memory / hook /
prompt_template / agent) + registry refresh (drift `⚠ DRIFT` / `✚ NEW`) feeding
`tuner__propose_external` → Scouts panel (weekly cadence via cron/systemd).

## 2. PANELS (the 7 from #285 + 4 new from recent PRs + 2 new asks)

**From #285 (kept):**

1. 🚪 **Human gate queue** — pending proposals (subject, source
   research/telemetry, diff preview, ✅/⏸/❌). ← `tuner__pending`.
2. 🔁 **Outcomes / OutcomeLoop** — baseline→fitness→verdict, observation
   window, auto-revert. ← `outcomes`+`priors`.
3. 📊 **Telemetry observability** — streams, availability/reason, fitness
   curves per subject. ← `telemetry__*`.
4. 🧩 **Subjects** — enabled/risk_tier/last cycle/# proposals. ← `subject_state`.
5. 🔬 **Scouts** — registry freshness, drift report, adversarial-verification
   rejects, source:research. ← registry `_meta`+logs.
6. 🔒 **Audit chain** — tamper-evident log, provenance, verify-chain ✓/✗. ← audit log.
7. 🌳 **Visual git tracking** — `[tuner]` commit timeline, before/after diff,
   blame, revert (3 layers), outcome↔commit link.

**NEW (from recent PRs):**

8. 🐕 **Watchdog / Forensics** — wedged PTY sessions (#297/#300), escalation
   warn→suspend→kill (#298), forensics dump, kill/flagged per invocation. The
   "safety" core of governance.
9. ⚙️ **Agent-jobs** — `dispatch_job`/`job_status`/`list_jobs`/`cancel_job`
   (#303): in-flight jobs per agent, state, results.
10. 🧪 **Bench / Eval** — eval-framework (#80): eval sets, runs (pass-rate +
    p50/95/99 + cost/call), `recommend_tier`, regression vs last run. The
    Tier-B that confirms #292 reroutes.
11. 🗂️ **Kanban** — subagent activity (#299), UI exists, integrate as a native
    panel.

*(A Hooks/Guards panel for #302 fits as a sub-view of Watchdog or Subjects —
PreToolUse refusals.)*

**NEW (operator asks):**

12. ⚙️ **Config** — a "variables" style settings page. Steer: subjects
    (enable/disable, risk_tier), per-subject degradation thresholds, scout
    cadence, reroute `qualityMetric`/tolerance, benchmark API key presence,
    gate auto-merge defaults. Writes to settings + `subject_state`
    (role-gated).
13. 💬 **Discussion / Chat** — converse with the agent from the app: inject →
    agent session (the "discuss" pattern that keeps context), streamed
    replies. A **"Discuss" button** on a proposal routes to the agent WITH the
    diff/context — this is exactly #288 §6's discuss path, extended into a
    page. GitHub Discussions available as a second channel.

## 2b. Whole features adoptable from the same blueprint

Beyond components, the reference dashboard has entire features that map 1:1:

| blueprint feature | → tuner app |
|---|---|
| variables page | **Config page** (§12) |
| alerts (rules + history) | **tuner alerts**: fitness regression, auto-revert, wedged session, registry drift |
| machines (+detail) | **host health** — tuner+scouts across hosts |
| members (roles) | **gate roles** (who can approve/refuse) = PermissionGate |
| sources | the scouts' **`sources.yaml`** (research allow-list, tiers) |
| skills page | **skills panel** (the skills subject has a face) |
| connectors / subscriptions | integrations + notification subscriptions |
| chat-bridge + discussions clients | messenger buttons already drive the gate; Discussions = 2nd chat channel |
| pipelines / projects | orchestration / grouping (optional) |

---

## 3. API CONTRACTS (single `/tuner/*` gateway)

- `GET /tuner/dashboard/summary` — summary cards: # pending, # applied 24h,
  # auto-reverts, stream health, wedged sessions, in-flight jobs.
- `GET /tuner/proposals?status=&source=` ← proposals joined with outcomes.
  `POST /tuner/apply/:id` · `/refuse/:id`.
- `GET /tuner/outcomes/:id` ← baseline/measured/verdict/commit_sha.
- `GET /tuner/telemetry/:stream` ← `telemetry__query` (read-only, #286).
- `GET /tuner/subjects` ← `subject_state` (enabled/risk_tier/cycle).
- `GET /tuner/scouts` ← registry `_meta` + drift + runs + verification rejects.
- `GET /tuner/audit?since=` ← audit chain + verify-chain.
- `GET /tuner/git/:repo/log` · `/diff/:sha` · `POST /tuner/git/revert/:sha`.
- `GET /tuner/watchdog/sessions` · `/forensics/:id` ← #297/#300/#298.

## 4. Blueprint reuse (components + patterns, 1:1)

| blueprint | → tuner app |
|---|---|
| `DashboardSummaryCard` + summary endpoint | tuner summary (§3) |
| `FeedItemCard` + feed endpoint | **unified Feed** (audit+outcomes+scouts+watchdog) |
| entity card (CRUD + results) | **SubjectCard** / **ProposalCard** (+ outcome result) |
| `JobCard` | **Agent-job card** (#303) |
| `StatusBadge` | pending/applied/refused/reverted, healthy/degraded, wedged/killed |
| `PermissionGate` | the human gate = mutations behind a role (approve/refuse) |
| workflows (steps/import/save) | proposal→apply→outcome pipeline (visualisation) |
| token/auth pattern (#220/#231) | tuner app auth |

---

## 5. PHASING (slots onto what is live)

- **Phase 1 — read-only** (low risk): Dashboard summary + Observability (3) +
  Outcomes (2) + Audit (6) + unified Feed. Every source already exists
  (`telemetry__*`, engine DB, audit log). = Phase 1 of #285.
- **Phase 2 — gate**: gate queue (1) approve/refuse + diff preview (already
  wired to a messenger — the app becomes the 2nd canonical surface).
- **Phase 3 — visual git + scouts**: Git (7) + Scouts (5) panels —
  timeline/diff/revert/drift.
- **Phase 4 — safety + jobs + bench**: Watchdog/Forensics (8) + Agent-jobs (9)
  + Bench/Eval (10) + Kanban (11) + Subjects (4).

---

## 6. Governance angle (unchanged, reinforced)

Everything mutating sits behind the **human gate**; the app makes
**provenance** visible (audit + verify-chain) + the **git trail** (clean
revert) + **safety** (watchdog/kill/forensics) — read-only first, mutating
surface second. The Watchdog/Forensics layer (8) is a new and strong
governance argument: kills/escalations visible and gated.
